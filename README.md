# HCI-Final-Project-Task-Management-Website

A user-friendly task management platform built for our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) final project. The website helps users manage daily tasks while optimizing schedules using the OpenAI API for smart task recommendations.

## Overview 

This web application provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, setting priorities, tracking deadlines, and receiving AI-driven recommendations to optimize productivity. It incorporates principles of HCI to ensure accessibility, usability, and intuitive user interaction.

## Features

1. Add, view, edit, and delete tasks
2. Sort tasks by priority and deadline
3. Track due dates
4. AI-powered task optimization and scheduling
5. Clean, accessible interface designed using HCI principles

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- Backend: Node.js
